		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The National Home and Hospice Care Survey (NHHCS) was reintroduced into the field in 2007 after a 7-year break. During that time, the survey was redesigned and expanded to include a computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) system, many new data items, and larger sample sizes of current home health patients and hospice discharges. All agencies that participated in the survey were either certified by Medicare and/or Medicaid or were licensed by a state to provide home health and/or hospice services and currently or recently served home health and/or hospice patients. Agencies that provided only homemaker services or housekeeping services, assistance with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), or durable medical equipment and supplies were excluded from the survey. The 2007 NHHCS included a supplemental survey of home health aides employed by home health and/or hospice agencies, called the National Home Health Aide Survey (NHHAS). The 2007 NHHCS data were collected through in-person interviews with agency directors and their designated staffs; no interviews were conducted directly with patients or their families and/or friends. Agency data collected, available in agency administrative records, included information on the year an agency was established, the types of services an agency provided, referral sources, specialty programs, and staffing characteristics. Data collected on home health patients and hospice discharges, available in medical records, included age, sex, race and ethnicity, services received, length of time since admission, diagnoses, medications taken, advance directives, and many other items.</p>
<p>The National Home Health Aide Survey (NHHAS), the first national probability survey of home health aides, was designed to provide national estimates of home health aides employed by agencies that provide home health and/or hospice care. The NHHAS survey instrument included sections on recruitment, training, job history, family life, management and supervision, client relations, organizational commitment and job satisfaction, workplace environment, work-related injuries, and demographics.</p></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Restrictions:</strong> In preparing the data files for this collection, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has removed direct identifiers and characteristics that might lead to identification of data subjects. As an additional precaution NCHS requires, under Section 308(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242m), that data collected by NCHS not be used for any purpose other than statistical analysis and reporting. NCHS further requires that analysts not use the data to learn the identity of any persons or establishments and that the director of NCHS be notified if any identities are inadvertently discovered. ICPSR member institutions and other users of data from ICPSR are expected to adhere to these restrictions.</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Time Period(s):</strong> 2007-08 -- 2008-02, 2007-09 -- 2008-04</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Date of Collection:</strong> 2007-08 -- 2008-02, 2007-09 -- 2008-04</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> The variable TOTALADL in Dataset 2 was labeled "inapplicable" for value 1 in error; -1 should have the label "inapplicable". Users may need to re-label this value and interpret the cases appropriately., Per agreement with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), ICPSR distributes the data files and text of the technical documentation for this collection as prepared by the NCHS., The variable PRN has been renamed to PRNORDER in the Patient dataset due to the fact that PRN is a reserved command in SPSS., Numeric recodes of the variables ADX1, CDDX1 through CDDX16, and PROCDX1 through PROCDX5 have been created in the Patient File. The values for variables ADX1 and CDX1 through CDX16 have been concatenated so that the values represent only the basic three-digit ICD-9 coding. In the same manner, the values for the variables PROCDX1 though PROCDX5 have been concatenated so that the values represent the basic two-digit ICD-9 procedures codes., Data users should be aware that the variable NOWSPECRC in the NHHAS dataset has been reduced from a column of width of 255 to 244 due to a STATA limitation. This reduction in column width affects all files associated with the NHHAS dataset. In reducing the column width, no data was altered or truncated.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> The 2007 National Home and Hospice Care Survey used a stratified two-stage probability design. The first stage, carried out by the NCHS, was the selection of home health and hospice agencies from the sample frame of over 15,000 agencies, representing the universe of agencies providing home health care and hospice services in the United States. The second stage of sample selection was completed by the interviewers during the agency interviews. Of the 1,545 agencies in the sample, 1,461 were considered in scope. Of the in-scope agencies, 1,036 agreed to participate.
The 2007 National Home Health Aide Survey used a two-stage probability sample design with the NHHCS agency sampled first and a random selection of aides from each of the paricipating sampled NHHCS agencies sampled second. Of the 1,036 agencies that participated in the 2007 NHHCS, 52 agencies had no aides to sample, resulting in 984 agencies eligible to participate in the NHHAS. Of the 984 eligible agencies, 955 agencies participated in the survey. From the 984 eligible agencies, 4,279 of the sample cases were eligible, and 3,377 aides completed the survey.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> The universe for the 2007 NHHCS was all eligible home health and hospice agencies within the United States. The universe for the 2007 NHHAS was all home health aides employed by eligible home health and hospice agencies within the United States.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> administrative records data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI)</span></p>

ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Created variable labels and/or value labels.</li><li>Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables.</li></ul></span></p>
