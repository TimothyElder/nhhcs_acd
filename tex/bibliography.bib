	abstract = {This review proposes that the end of life is a uniquely contemporary life course stage. Epidemiologic, technological, and cultural shifts over the past two centuries have created a context in which dying has shifted from a sudden and unexpected event to a protracted, anticipated transition following an incurable chronic illness. The emergence of an end-of-life stage lasting for months or even years has heightened public interest in enhancing patient well-being, autonomy, and the receipt of medical care that accords with patient and family members’ wishes. We describe key components of end-of-life well-being and highlight socioeconomic and race disparities therein, drawing on fundamental cause theory. We describe two practices that are critical to end-of-life well-being (advance care planning and hospice) and identify limitations that may undermine their effectiveness. We conclude with recommendations for future sociological research that could inform practices to enhance patient and family well-being at the end of life.},

	abstract = {Socioeconomic status ({SES}) gradients in mortality risk are well documented, although less is known about whether the quality of older adults’ dying experiences is stratified by {SES}. I focus on six core components of a “good death”: pain and symptom management, acceptance, medical care that is concordant with one’s preferences, dying at home, emotional preparation, and formal preparations for end-of-life care. Analyses are based on four data sets spanning the 1980s through 2010s, a period marked by rising economic inequalities: Changing Lives of Older Couples (1986–1994), Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (1993–2010), New Jersey End of Life study (2005–2007), and Wisconsin Study of Families and Loss (2010–2014). I find evidence of {SES} disparities in two outcomes only: pain and advance care planning ({ACP}), widely considered an important step toward a “good death.” Implications for health care policy and practice, against the backdrop of the Affordable Care Act implementation, are discussed.},
